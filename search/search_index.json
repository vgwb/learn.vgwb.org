A game also involves players-active participants interacting with the system of the game in order to experience the play of the game. Not all games need a conflict, a contest between players (e.g., solo games such as solitaire or cooperative games).

Broadly speaking, there are two general metaphors that have been historically utilized by the educational research community to define and describe learning. 1. The first view characterizes learning as acquisition, be it the acquisition of knowledge, skills, dispositions, behaviors, or other outcomes deemed desirable by educators and institutions. This generally aligns with what scholars call a cognitive perspective on learning, which emphasizes internal mental processes such as memory, decision-making, thinking, and knowledge construction as fundamental to learning. It also speaks to behaviorist conceptions of learning, which tend to emphasize observable behaviors as indicators of learning. 2. The second metaphor characterizes learning as participation and emphasizes processes of socialization, mentorship, participation, and social practice. Within the field of education, this metaphor generally informs scholarship identified with a sociocultural perspective on learning, which tends to highlight social practices, identities, and relationships as core to learning.</p>"},{"location":"dgbl/10_dgbl/#what-is-game-based-learning","title":"What is game based learning?","text":"<p>Game-based learning is a pedagogical approach that involves designing learning activities through games where the game characteristics and game principles inhere within the learning activities themselves.</p> <p>The design of more engaging curriculum needs to include techniques that teaches students how to be critical, confident and creative as well as abilities that they will need for success in the work-a-day future life.

These include games installed as software on personal computers, as well as games played through television-attached gaming consoles such as the Sony PlayStation or Microsoft Xbox. Digital game platforms also include dedicated handheld platforms, such as the Nintendo Gameboy and its various incarnations, as well as mobile smartphones and tablet computers.

The first is that digital games can offer experiences of interactivity that are generally characterized by both immediacy and focus. This is largely by virtue of the fact that digital games are programmed into computers. Programming provides increased immediacy of feedback because the system is automated to respond to player input. Programming also provides a narrowed range of interactivity because possible player inputs and outcomes are limited by what a digital game developer has programmed into the software. 2. Second, digital games and digital media more broadly make use of a computer\u2019s affordances for collecting, storing, retrieving, manipulating, revealing, or even concealing information in the form of images, text, animations, sound, and even player behavioral data. 3. Third, due to their computational nature, digital games have the potential to automate systems and procedures that may be far more complex for non-digital games to simulate. Examples of these complex systems include simulated environmental features in computer-based role-playing games: terrain\u2013movement interactions, lines of sight, weather cycles, and even interactions with animals or non-player characters in the virtual game world. 4. Finally, many (although not all) contemporary digital games have the ability to facilitate communication between players across networks, such as the online networks that connect players in multiplayer, internet-connected games. These communication-facilitating features can include technologies that enable voice or text chat between players within a particular game.</p>"},{"location":"dgbl/10_dgbl/#what-is-digital-game-based-learning","title":"What is Digital Game-Based Learning?","text":"<p>Digital game-based learning refers to learning by solving problems or accomplishing tasks through computers, mobile phones, or tablets. There are several elements in digital game-based learning, such as fun, play, goals, competition, and problem-solving.</p> <p>Studies have investigated DGBL in different subjects, such as Literacy, Maths, Sciences, and STEAM. The results indicate that DGBL could improve students\u2019 learning motivation, learning performance, reduce their cognitive load and anxiety.</p> <p>{: .highlight }</p>  <p>Game based learning (GBL) is a type of game play that has defined learning outcomes. Digital game based learning (DGBL) refers to using actual digital video games as learning tools.</p>  <p>A critical appraisal of the game-based aspect of DGBL can help better situate the usage of this concept in theory and practice. Building on learning as an acquisition metaphor, one way to define game-based learning in DGBL is by the use of digital games to promote the acquisition of a variety of knowledge, skills, dispositions, or other educational outcomes. According to this definition, learning is game-based when digital games, or certain elements of digital games such as scorekeeping, are applied toward identifiable outcomes defined by educators or institutions. </p> <p>Another framing of DGBL learning as participation metaphor, characterizes the game-based aspect of DGBL as an inherent part of meaningfully participating in - that is, playing - games, regardless of their connection to some external educational outcome. According to this definition, learning is always happening when someone plays a game. Having to solve problems, overcome obstacles, or collaborate with others within and around games are all dimensions of learning.  As game designer and theorist Raph Koster noted in A Theory of Fun book, a game is only \u201cgood\u201d to the degree that it is \u201cfun,\u201d and a game is only fun to the degree which players are being challenged to learn to be successful in that game space.</p>"},{"location":"dgbl/10_dgbl/#gamification","title":"Gamification","text":"<p>Gamification, often categorized as a subconcept of DGBL, describes the implementation of certain aspects of digital games (visual displays of progress, automated reward systems, scoring leaderboards, virtual avatars, and others) into non-gaming contexts such as education, business management, marketing, and even physical exercise programs.</p>"},{"location":"dgbl/10_dgbl/#engagement","title":"Engagement","text":"<p>Engaging students in classroom content is always a hard task, and traditional forms of education have become expected and somewhat redundant, that the learning capacities of students are very weak.

Some people are more intrinsically motivated by a task while another person sees the same activity extrinsically.</p> <p>Both can be effective, but research suggests that extrinsic rewards should be used sparingly because of the overjustification effect. Extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation when used in certain situations or used too often. The rewards may lose their value when you reward behavior that was already intrinsically motivating. Some people also perceive extrinsic reinforcement as coercion or bribery.</p> <p>The overjustification effect has inspired an entire field of study that focuses on students and how to help them reach their full potential. Though experts are divided on whether extrinsic rewards have a beneficial or negative effect on intrinsic motivation, a recent study showed that rewards may actually encourage intrinsic motivation when given early in a task.</p> <p>Researchers examined how reward timing influenced intrinsic motivation. They found that giving an immediate bonus for working on a task, rather than waiting until the task was completed, increased interest and enjoyment in it. Getting an earlier bonus increased motivation and persistence in the activity that continued even after the award was removed.</p> <p>Understanding the factors that promote intrinsic motivation can help you see how it works and why it can be beneficial. These factors include:</p> <ul> <li>Curiosity. Curiosity pushes us to explore and learn for the sole pleasure of learning and mastering.</li> <li>Challenge. Being challenged helps us work at a continuously optimal level work toward meaningful goals.</li> <li>Control. This comes from our basic desire to control what happens and make decisions that affect the outcome.</li> <li>Recognition. We have an innate need to be appreciated and satisfaction when our efforts are recognized and appreciated by others.</li> <li>Cooperation. Cooperating with others satisfies our need for belonging. We also feel personal satisfaction when we help others and work together to achieve a shared goal.</li> <li>Competition. Competition poses a challenge and increases the importance we place on doing well.</li> <li>Fantasy. Fantasy involves using mental or virtual images to stimulate your behavior.

For example in MineCraft students build structures and \u201cWhen night comes and creepers attack, only the students who stayed in fortified structures survive.

Each game tells a story. Assessing learning with these games, educators can use Office 365 or Google Docs. For example, English literature teacher Paul Darvasi has his students play the point-and-click exploration game Gone Home, which is about a dysfunctional family.
